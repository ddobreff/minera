Requirements
-------------

Minera should be installed on the mining controller, usually a Raspberry, with a Debian-like Linux distribution and of course an internet connection.

**Note**: You need a decent modern browser, Minera web interface it's NOT tested (and never will be) against IE, so please if you want have the best user experience **DO NOT use Internet Explorer** as browser.
_______

Installing
-------------

You can choose for a img file to put in your SD Card or for a manual install.

**Image file (img) v0.8.0 (Recommended)**

This is the Minera image file for Raspberry PI, you have only to download it and put in your SD Card.

You need at least a 4GB SD Card:

Official Europe server:

**[Download minera-latest.img.zip](http://getminera.com/download/latest)**

**[Download from Torrent minera-latest.img.zip](https://getminera.com/releases/minera-latest.img.zip.torrent)**

**Magnet link: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:4c77cb95769cba095b31993303304a15637b0024&dn=minera-latest.img.zip**

After boot up your controller, point your browser to:

```
http://<your-controller-ip>/minera/
```

Default passwords are "*minera*" you should change them as well as the miner settings.
_______

**Manual install (Some skills needed)**

If you prefer you can simply install Minera on your current Linux controller. Check if it's a debian based one otherwise download and install a right distribution.
If you have a Raspberry, I suggest you to install Raspbian you can get it here:

> http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest

Simply download and put it in your SD card (there are tons of guide to do this, google it).

When you have your system ready, ssh into it and **install Minera**

You can use this script to install everything you need, (it's good for any kind of Debian system: Ubuntu, Raspbian, ecc...) or use the manual steps below:

    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getminera/minera/master/install_minera_ubuntu.sh | sudo bash

Skip this step and continue below if you have a web server with PHP just installed.

```
sudo apt-get install -y lighttpd php7.0-cgi
sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi
sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi-php
sudo service lighttpd force-reload
```

When your web server is ready you can install Minera:

```
sudo apt-get install -y redis-server git screen php7.0-cli php7.0-curl
cd /var/www
sudo git clone https://github.com/getminera/minera
cd minera
sudo ./install_minera.sh
```

The installer will configure the system requirements and will tell you the URL to connect to.

    Default URL: http://<your-controller-ip>/minera/

	Default password: minera

**Important**: minera system user has password "minera", you should change it if your system is a public host with SSH access.

	sudo passwd minera

This isn't the web password, to change the web password, login into the web interface and go to *Miner -> Settings*

**Miner command**

The *miner command* binary path is:

	minera-bin/<miner>

They are pre-compiled for Raspberry (ARM) with the latest version available, please refer to each one if you wanna recompile it or use the [build script](#building-miner-software).

**For Ubuntu user only**

If you want use any miner software on Ubuntu (or any other system architecture) you need to compile it and put the binary file in "minera-bin/" directory, pre-built miners are only for ARM architecture.
_______

Upgrading
-------------

Minera will show you a notification icon in the upper right corner if a new version is available. Click the link to run the upgrade.
Your miner will not be stopped, but you should restart it to take full advantages of updates.

If you wanna run and update manually or if you are in trouble and you wanna get a fresh updated code, just SSH into Minera and run these commands:

```
cd /var/www/minera
sudo git fetch --all
sudo git reset --hard origin/master
sudo ./upgrade_minera.sh
```

Your Minera system should be upgraded with the latest commit available.
_______

Configuring
-------------

Minera has a complete settings page where you can choose many options to start your miners.

You can add or remove pools for failover and select to be guided or to write your own configuration.

Go to settings (*Miner -> Settings*) and choose your preferred options.

A sample settings is pre-configured when you run the install_minera.sh script.

Please remember to change your minera's settings or you will mine for my workers :)
_______

Building miner software
-------------

Since version 0.3.6 Minera comes with a script to build updated version of every single miner software.

If you are in trouble with your binary file of Bfgminer for example, you can simply connect in SSH and run this:

```
cd /var/www/minera
./build_miner.sh <miner-name>
```

The script will do everything you need to have the binary file in the correct place and updated.

If you need a list of miner available just run the command without any argument.
_______

Troubleshooting
-------------

If you wanna check your minera's screen session just SSH into it and attach the session:

	ssh minera@<your-minera-ip>
	screen -r

If you receive the following error:

	Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check.

Please run this commands:

	script /dev/null
	screen -r

If you have guided/manual options both selected in the settings page try run this:

	echo -n "1" | redis-cli -x set guided_options
	redis-cli del manual_options

If you wanna check the raw JSON stats from your minerd, please point your browser to:

	http://<your-minera-ip>/minera/index.php/app/stats
	
If you wanna use a new Raspberry PI 2 and you are running a Minera version <= 0.4.0, you need to first upgrade packages from an old Raspberry, then you can use the same SD Card on the new one.
Get a Raspberry PI (not 2), push the Minera SD Card on it, turn on and SSH into it, then run these commands:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

This could take a while (I mean also an hour, it's slow), but after that you can run your Minera SD Card in any Raspberry PI model, new ones included.
